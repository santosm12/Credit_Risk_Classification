Summary
 A lending company needs a model to distinguish healthy loans from non-healthy ones accurately, as misclassification can lead to customer loss or financial loss. The Logistic Regression model with Oversampled data outperformed the one with Imbalanced data, showing higher accuracy and recall. Fewer False Positives are crucial to avoid misclassifying non-healthy loans as healthy. Comparing confusion matrices, Model 2 (Logistic Regression with Balanced data) is recommended due to its reduced False Positives, indicating better classification accuracy.
